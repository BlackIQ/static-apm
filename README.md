# APM Static package

Static sample projectis just a sample project and here is what I usualy do for each new static project.

### What is APM?

**APM** stands for,

- Amirhossein
- Package
- Manager

This package manager help me to create new project fast. Before doing this project, I always was creating new directories, files, route stuff and Javascript repeted codes. Now I onley say `apn -c pure-php` and it will create sample Php code for me.

This project has a runner that is written by **Bash script**, **C** and some parts with **Python**.

If I amke any changes in this sample codes, there will be a new release.

### How this project works?

After new releases, sample codes will be zipped and upload in release. Application download the zipped file and unzip it. After that is customizing.

It is like when you create a new **React** or **Laravel** application. It has some pre ready codes that you have to change.

### APM Core

APM code is open source like other projects.

The code is in ['/BlackIQ/apn-cli'](https://github.com/BlackIQ/apn-cli) and the site is not completed yet.
